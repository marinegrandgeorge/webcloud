We have created a script that deploys an offline version of Wikipedia to a distant server

We are going to to explain you how to deploy our project to your own computer.
There are two files :
  README.md ; Text file with information for deployement
  deploy.sh : bash script for deployement

  <h2> Prerequisites </h2>
   To deploy your website, you need :
        A server with Linux (with Digital Ocean, as an example)
        A terminal (GitBash for example)
        An internet connexion
        Private and public keys from your computer
        With Digital Ocean, you will need to create a clean droplet to create your Ubuntu server
        The IP adress of your server


      Deployement :
        Open your terminal
        Go to the cloud webcloud's folder on your computer  : $cd~...\FOLDER\
        Connect to the distant server : $~ssh root @XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
        Enter yes if they ask you
        Go to your browser and enter your server's ip adress

        If you have correctly followed the different steps, the deployment should have succesfully worked.
